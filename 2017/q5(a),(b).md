##(a) What is curse of dimension (COD)?
As the dimension of data increases, the performance of classifiers increase, however after a certain dimension, its performance starts to drop.  

That's why we say it is a curse of dimensionality.  

As a data scientist, we need to understand this, so that we would not blindly use as much dimension as possible.  

However, the case mentioned above is not always true, because COD usually only occurs when the data are very uniformly distributed.  However, most of the data in real-time is not really uniformly distributed, this is also known as **non-uniformity blessing**.

##(b) How to avoid COD?
*Reduce the dimensionality of the data.*  

This can be done by using for example, using a feature selection algorithm.  

Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for use in model construction.
