## (i) Difference between ConvNet and typical MLP?

- Convolutional Neural Networks are MLPs with a special structure. 
CNN have repetitive layers of neurons that are applied across space(for images) or time(for audio signals).  
- In MLP, all the features are given as input in oneshot, however in CNN, the feautures are manipulated using Convolution, thus the features are actually splitted into different smaller features.

## (ii) 
- Real-time gaming
    - For example, OpenAI use deep-learning to create an AI for playing as Shadow Fiend in a Dota-1v1 match
- Go Chess
    - For example, AlphaGo use deep-learning to learn Go chess, and they had beaten the best Go player last year at China
