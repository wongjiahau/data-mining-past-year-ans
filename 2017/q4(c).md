## Association analysis
Assocication analysis AKA Market Basket Analysis (MBA). It is to find the association between items in a retail shop.  For example, if I run MBA on this retail shop, I might find that Coke is highly associated with Pampers.  Thus, the shop retailer should place Pampers near Coke to increase their sales.
