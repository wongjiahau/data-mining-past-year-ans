## q2(b)
- Clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm while classification is a supervised algorithm 
- To use classificiation, your data need to be labelled first, if not you cannot train the classifier
- However in clustering, your data need not to be labelled, because the algorithm will help you determine which data belongs to one group
- In clustering, the algorithm tries to understand relationship between data points
- In classification, the algorithm tries to relate each data point with their respective labels

## q2(c)
- Image compression
    - This is done using color quantization, which is a method used to cluster pixel with similar RGB value into one group. 
    - For example, you can compress an image with 255 * 255 * 255 colors into image with only 10 colors, the algorithm will group all the pixel into 10 cluster, and assign each of the pixel with the cluster mean value
- Fraud detection
    - this can be done by analyzing the data of each transaction, and try to fit them into the previously trained clustered algorithm, if the data points does have very far distance to every previously-determined clusters, the transaction is probably a fraud

## (d)
K-Mean clustering,
- In K-Mean clustering, you have to specify the number of cluster you wish to produce (let say you wish to have 3 cluster, so k=3)
- Then, it will randomly pick 3 points to be the center of each clusters 
- Then, it will calculate the Euclidean distance from every point to each cluster centers
- For each distance calculated, the point will be group into the cluster where it has the least distance to it
- After the grouping is completed, the cluster center (or cluster mean) will be recalculated again (this can be done using various method)
- Then the process will repeat from step 2 until this step until there are no significane divergence anymore
- The divergence means the change in cluster centers
