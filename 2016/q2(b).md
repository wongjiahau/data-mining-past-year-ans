## (i)
Classification

## (ii)
Supervise learning. Because all the training data can be labelled with a specific label. For example, I can label photo with KLCC as Kuala Lumpur.

## (iii)
- 1. Load the data
- 2. Seperate the data into test and training data (e.g. Holdout, KFold etc.)
- 3. Preprocess the training data (e.g. feature selecture, normalization etc.)
- 4. Initialize the classifier with suitable parameters
- 5. Train the classifier with the training data
- 6. Predict the label of each test data
- 7. Calculate the performance of the model using metric score (e.g. precision, accuracy, recall, confusion matrix etc.)
- 8. Repeat the whole process, but by changing the parameters or changing the method of data preprocession

## (iv)
- Large amount of data
- Fast processor (to train those data)
- Experience, if you have experience you might know how to tune the parameters in order to get the best model

## (v)
Using some of the following method:
- Confusion matrix
- Metric score 
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
- Cross validation
    - K-Fold 
    - Holdout
