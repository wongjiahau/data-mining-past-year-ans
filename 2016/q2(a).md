## (i)
- Similarity between Decision Tree and Neural Network
    - Both algorithm are supervised learning algorithm
    - Both are algorithm for doing classification

- Difference between Decision Tree and Neural Network
    - Decision tree will throw away some input feature if it think it is not useful
    - Neural Network will consider every input feature during training

## (ii)
- Advantange of NN against DT
    - NN can model more arbitary function (non-linear function, etc.) than DT, so NN might be more accurate (provided there is enough data)

- Disadvantage of NN against DT
    - NN has slower performance in terms of training and predicting
    - NN produces model that is not really interpretable (mostly numbers), however DT will produce an interpretable model that can be visualize easily
