## (i)
Class 1 (Star), because in most of the scatter plots, Star usually group together as one cluster, however Circle and Triangle seems to clutter together in most of the scatter plots, so Class 1 (Star) is the most separable one to other classes.

## (ii)
Attrib #0. (I'm not sure the answer.)

## (iii)
Attrib #0 and Attrib #2, because we can see in the scatter plot of [Attrib#0 vs Attrib#2], the data points of each classes cluster together well.
