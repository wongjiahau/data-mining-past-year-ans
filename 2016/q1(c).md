## (i)
- numpy.ndarray 
    - Multidimensional container of items of same type and size
    - For example: numpy.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
- pandas.DataFrame
    - 2-dimensional tabular data, with labelled axes
    - size-mutable

## (ii)
- When to use `numpy.ndarray`?
    - When you want to have data of more than 2 dimensions
    - It is usually for number-crunching such as machine learning
- When to use `pandas.DataFrame`?
    - When you want to have 2 dimensional data with headings/labels
    - It is usally useful for feature selection
    - For example, when you load a CSV file with 100 columns and you want to select only a few columns, using `DataFrame` is suitable for this task
