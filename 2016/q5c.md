## What is curse of dimensionality(COD)?
In general, we tend to think that if we include more dimension(AKA features) to do training, we will get better accuracy from the model.  

However, this is not necessarily true, although including more and more dimension of data for training will increase the model accuracy, the accuracy will fall after certain number of dimensions.  

Not only that, including feature that are noisy will cause the model accuracy to drop as well.

Thus, we call this situation as Curse Of Dimensionality.  

So, as a data scientist we need to understand this, that's why Feature Selection is a very important step in Machine Learning.
